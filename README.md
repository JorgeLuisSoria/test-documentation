# README

This YAML file is a template that can be used to document, manually, REST APIs built on Apex of Salesforce.

If you want to edit and see your changes automatically in your VSCode. I highly recommend you to use this two extensions:

1. Yaml: Extensions from RedHat that allows you to edit yml.files
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml
2. OpenAPI(Swagger) Editor: This extensions allows you to render your documentation and explore its content in a dynamic way
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi

If you want to see your changes in real time, you have to press Ctrl(Cmd)+Shift+P and type OpenAPI: show preview using Swagger UI
